# Hello, I have create a similar replica of the classic monopoly board game.
The application is currently using react, react-bootstrap, reactstrap, and sass.

### My choice for creating this project
My kids enjoy playing monopoly and I decided to use that as a learning tool to create a fun and exciting game and use what I have learned as well as developer a
game and extend my knowledge.


### About the project
I created the project back in 2021.
As I have learned more and am applying my skills to do more projects and aquire a job in web development.
I restructrued the components. Used less code. Applied my knowledge about sass and react towards rebuilding this game.

## Currently the game is not mobile responsive and is structured towards a minimum screen. 
I am continuing this project and will work on functionality as I go. Though this is a fun game. I
do believe that keeping it on a desktop platform is better at the moment.

### Difficulties
The hardest thing about coding and styling was getting the cards and the grid placement correctly.

### Whats Next
Next is working on starting the game.
creating a button to start the play.
Creating dice.
A instructional modal that pops up before the game starts.
Providing pieces to the board.
I will be using react-spring in order to flip the cards over and provide an option to buy based 
on the original rules.

### Future goals

My goal for this in the future is for people to be able to play with several players.
Also adding functionality like more libraries of different styles and pieces and themes.
